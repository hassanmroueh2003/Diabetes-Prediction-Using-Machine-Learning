# 🧠 Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project builds and evaluates a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on patient medical data using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. It explores key features, performs data cleaning, and compares multiple classification models to identify the most effective predictor.
